  <h2>Bonito</h2>
    <p>Bonito is a small Brazilian city located
       in the Bodoquena Sierra in the state
       of Mato Grosso do Sul - a region with
       a tropical climate. The city is located
       in the middle of the Bodoquena Sierra
       plateau, where the soil is predominantly
       formed by calcareous rocks, which are
       responsible for the crystal clear waters
       of the region that draw so many tourists
       who want to snorkel and dive.
